# Project Goal: Entity Recognition and Link Detection

The goal of this project is to recognize person, product, and company entities in texts and detect their potential links. Person entities are quite well recognized, while products and companies are more challenging.

   Preprocess the data to make it suitable for training.
3. **Chose the Roadmap for the models to be used**  
   Decide on the models to be used for entity recognition and link detection.
4. **Model Training**  
   Train the models on the training data.
5. **Model Evaluation**
6. **Model Testing**
